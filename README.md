# ShoppingList
A shopping list app

## Install
First, make sure you have Xcode installed and the react-native environment. See https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/learn/v4/t/lecture/5740468?start=0

To install and run the app:
1. download the code. And open your terminal, go to the downloaded folder ShoppingList. `cd ShoppingList`
2. when you are in the ShoppingList folder, in your terminal, execute `npm install`
3. after finishing installing, to run the app, execute `react-native run-ios`. Then it will start compiling and it may take several minutes. After finishing compiling, it will open your iPhone simulator (from Xcode I think).
4. In your iPhone simulator, click on the app called 'ShoppingList', the icon is blank for now.
